Project Title: YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

Problem Statement:
Develop a comprehensive system to ethically and responsibly harvest data from various YouTube channels, enabling users to access and analyze channel and video-specific information. This project involves the ethical scraping of YouTube content while adhering to terms and conditions, obtaining proper authorization, and following data protection regulations.

Outcome:
Successfully designed and implemented a user-friendly application using Streamlit, Python, and various APIs to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data. Utilized MongoDB as a data lake for initial storage and later migrated the data to a SQL database (SQLite) for efficient querying and analysis. The ethical considerations in data scraping were prioritized, ensuring responsible handling and preventing misuse of collected data.

Tools Used:

Streamlit:

Developed a user-friendly UI for interacting with the application, facilitating data retrieval and analysis operations.
Python:

Primary programming language for the entire project, covering data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualization.
Google API Client:

Utilized the googleapiclient library to communicate with YouTube's Data API v3, enabling the retrieval of channel details, video specifics, and comments.
MongoDB:

Employed MongoDB as a document database for initial storage, taking advantage of its scalability and support for structured or unstructured data.
SQLite (as part of SQL):

Used SQLite as a relational database for the migration of data from the data lake, providing efficient querying and analysis capabilities.
Ethical Considerations:

Emphasized ethical practices throughout the project, respecting YouTube's terms and conditions, obtaining proper authorization, and adhering to data protection regulations. Ensured responsible handling of collected data to maintain privacy, confidentiality, and prevent misuse or misrepresentation.
